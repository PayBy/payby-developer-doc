In some payment scenarios, in addition to the basic order interface, other interfaces need to be used to complete the complete business process.

<br/>

For example, in the `Auto Debit` scenario,  the customer needs to sign the automatic debit agreement first, so that the agreement number can be used to create an automatic payment order; and in the `Iframe Paypage` scenario, ther merchant needs to create an iFrame in a predefined div element to decide how the UI looks, etc.

<br/>

Please visit the menu according to the payment scenario you need.
