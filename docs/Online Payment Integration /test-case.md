# Test case

Use the following integration cases to review your integration qualities. To create a good user experience, ensure that the common payment scenarios are properly handled.

Notes:

- Use iValidate ONLY when your product is ready to go live.
- To simulate real payment scenarios, all test cases must be started by using PAYMENT TERMINALS, rather than by manually calling APIs.
- After your product goes live, PayBy will analyze your transaction status and identify the hidden integration problems or problems casued by code changes.
